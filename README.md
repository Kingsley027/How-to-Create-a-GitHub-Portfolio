# 📚 How to Create a GitHub Portfolio

Hi there, I'm Katie! 🙋🏻‍♀️

This is a **fuss-free, simple** guide to create your GitHub portfolio. 

It's perfect for
- Beginners in data science who wants to showcase samples of work, or projects.
- Serves as a digital resume to show that you have the skills in your resume. 
- A fun way to keep track of your projects.

**Why I created this repo?**
- I was once intimidated by GitHub myself. I signed up in March, but left it aside as I did not understand how it works.
- Since then, I have learnt how to use it (I'm quite obsessed with writing in Markdowns 😆), so I would love to share this knowledge with everyone. 🙂

_You can learn how to do this neat table of contents too! It's very easy. 😉_

## Introduction 

Let's understand some of the alien terms that you will see on GitHub.

📌 `Repository/repo` means `folder`. It is similar to creating folders on your computer. Each repository represents one folder. You can create multiple repositories for different projects. 

📌 `README.md` is a default note, or summary that is usually included in each repo. It acts as the "homepage" of your repo where you can introduce the project,  provide a summary, or anything - so feel free to write it.

📌 `Fork` in layman means `copy + paste`. Let's say you want to make a copy of this guide, have access to it, and edit and play around with the codes. You can do it! Any changes made in your copy of the file would not be reflected in this guide. I'll teach you how to do it below.

You do not need to download the GitHub Desktop to set up your portfolio. Your browser would do the job just fine. 🙂

## How to Create Your Profile?

**Are you interested in creating a Profile that appears on your GitHub homepage, _like mine_?**

**Step 1: Click on `+` and `New Repository` at top right of the page.**

<kbd><img width="257" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135068335-12538e85-8090-4f27-8232-47bfcc15b2c2.png"></kbd>

**Step 2: Create a new repository with the _exact name as your username_.**

My username is "**katiehuangx**", so I created a new repository named "**katiehuangx**". This repository will contain the write-up of your profile.

<kbd><img width="741" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-28 at 6 15 33 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135102196-6eeea30a-a874-4fb3-a4f6-25db97d6c825.png"></kbd>

The format of the file is `Markdown (.md)`. Its default name is `README.md`, so you can leave it as that. 

<kbd><img width="720" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-28 at 6 18 40 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135102549-9bc47d7f-d803-4cc2-a8a2-361c900a6b96.png"></kbd>

**Step 3: To edit your Profile or Markdown file, hover over the `pencil ✏️` icon on your right and click `Edit this file`.**

<kbd><img width="354" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-28 at 10 29 37 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135107847-f86bef5c-2f26-4942-9de2-104c446825e1.png"></kbd>

**Now you can start to write your profile! 😄 Once you're happy with the contents, scroll down and click `Commit changes`.**

### 📝 What to write in your profile?

It's entirely up to you and your creativity! Most people would include:
- An introduction of yourself
- Skills like Data Analysis, SQL, Python, Tableau, Web Development, etc
- Fancier things like visitor count, clickable icons, etc (can't help you with this as I've not learn it yet 😅)
- Projects that you're proud of

## How to Customize Markdown files?

GitHub's Markdown guides are excellent and comprehensive enough, yet easily understandable. This is where I learn to customize mine too. 🙂

- How to customize Markdown files - [Github Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- How to create tables - [GitHub Organizing information with tables](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables)
- How to colour code your SQL, Python, etc code blocks (This is my favourite part!) - [GitHub Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks)
- **Bonus tip**: How to add emojis? 🌟🙌🏻🙋🏻‍♀️📚🌤🐶
  - For Windows: Windows logo key + . (period)
  - For Mac: Control + Command + Spacebar

### 🌌 Add Images

Normally what I would do is take a screenshot, or download the image. 

Then, I **copy the image file** and **paste in the Markdown file** itself. Give it around 3-5 seconds to load the image. 

<kbd><img width="619" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135247149-4cddb744-cc6e-4b20-92fa-fd768da95d7f.png"></kbd>

**Uploading screenshot...**

<kbd><img width="417" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135276525-a3b870af-8ece-494f-b1cb-be843ce18602.png"></kbd>

**Successfully uploaded screenshot!**

<kbd><img width="1099" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135276620-e8212cea-cccc-4532-969a-241f107b459b.png"></kbd>

**Click `Preview` to check your newly uploaded image.**

<kbd><img width="476" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-29 at 5 58 48 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135276747-73e27341-bfcf-4b32-9a8f-92deedc067c5.png"></kbd>

### 📚 Add Table of Contents

Below is the code block for my table of contents. 

````
## Table of Contents
- [How to Create Your Profile?](#how-to-create-your-profile)
- [How to Customize Markdown files?](#how-to-customize-markdown-files)
- [How to Create New Repository?](#how-to-create-new-repository)
````

To ensure that you retrieve the correct `(#xx-xx-xx)`:

**Click on the chain logo beside your title. Right click and open in new tab.**
<img width="508" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-29 at 6 04 22 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135248350-9ba54965-863e-4408-8e02-eb8cd596c2a8.png">

**Navigate to the website link and scroll all the way to the end and copy the highlighted `##xx-xx-xx`.**
<img width="678" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-29 at 6 04 57 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135248359-2ed3ea2e-2a8b-4f07-8f7c-80b053d42497.png">

Do not include emojis in your title, otherwise the links in the table of contents would not work.

_Psst_, the links in the table of contents do not work in `Preview`. You have to `Commit changes` in order to check if the links work.

### 🧱 Colour Code the Code Blocks

If you've seen my [8 Week SQL Challenge repo](https://github.com/katiehuangx/8-Week-SQL-Challenge), I use colour codes for my SQL syntax. It's very easy to do and makes your syntax look professional too.

````
```sql -- Add 3 backticks followed by sql
SELECT *
FROM student_info
WHERE student_name = 'Katie';
``` -- Add 3 backticks
````

This is how it will turn out:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM student_info
WHERE student_name = 'Katie';
```

## How to Create New Repository?

Creating a new repo is as easy as creating your profile.

**Step 1: Click on `New Repository` at the top right of the page.**

<kbd><img width="257" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135068335-12538e85-8090-4f27-8232-47bfcc15b2c2.png"></kbd>

The image below is the default setting. If you forgot to tick `Add a README.md`, you can create the file separately in the repo later.

<kbd><img width="615" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-28 at 9 55 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135103549-c7d87461-adb5-4b6c-b65b-72842e2f374c.png"></kbd>

And, it's done. You have created your first repo! 😎

## How to Create Subfolders in your Repository?

**Step 1: Navigate to the right side of the page. Click `Add File` and `Create New File`.**

<kbd><img width="879" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-28 at 10 41 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135109960-52721c55-810e-47d9-a463-8c19d9ece947.png"></kbd>

**Step 2: Name your file followed by the extension `.md`, or your desired format.**

<kbd><img width="610" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-28 at 10 42 05 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135110652-99d4b7da-9339-4324-b564-5d217bf4cfbd.png"></kbd>

## How to Upload Projects in your Repository?

**Step 1: Navigate to the right side of the page. Click `Add File` and `Upload File`.**

<kbd><img width="397" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135250389-cece0d81-19fa-4021-beb1-2bd4fb3bc09c.png"></kbd>

**Step 2: `Choose your file`, wait for file to load completely and click `Commit changes`**

Once your file is uploaded completely, it will look like the one in my screenshot below. Bigger file size would take a longer time to load. 🙂

<kbd><img width="1052" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-29 at 6 19 34 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135250662-8d19c9b6-7b57-4e15-90da-efd174d5d8a0.png"></kbd>

And, that's it! It's as simple as that!

## How to Fork a Repository?

Let'say I'm checking out this awesome repo and I'm curious to see how he adds the icons, Twitter button, and all the cool stuffs.

<kbd><img width="1419" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-30 at 10 50 08 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135378085-28f76e0e-9449-4bd9-8ceb-47a387b7788d.png"></kbd>

<kbd><img width="439" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-30 at 10 52 45 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135378187-26b26415-d194-448b-aba7-9f54dc000b5e.png"></kbd>

**Step 2: It's done!**

GitHub has `forked` and copied the repo and added it as one of your repo. Now, you can edit the file and learn how to add those fancy, cool stuffs too!

<kbd><img width="661" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-30 at 10 50 44 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135378329-8d0df892-ed3e-466d-8fe8-3c912065179c.png"></kbd>
